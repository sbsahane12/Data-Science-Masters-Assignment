    "'''MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented database system that stores data in flexible, semi-structured JSON-like documents, rather than in traditional tables with fixed columns and rows like in SQL databases. It is designed to be scalable, flexible, and efficient, making it ideal for many modern web and mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a type of database management system that do not use the traditional table-based relational database model. Instead, they use different models, such as document-oriented, key-value, graph-based, and column-family databases, to store and manage data. These databases are often preferred for their scalability, performance, and flexibility, as well as their ability to handle unstructured and semi-structured data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many scenarios where MongoDB may be preferred over SQL databases. For example, when dealing with large volumes of rapidly changing data, such as in social media or e-commerce applications, MongoDB's flexible document model can make it easier to manage and query data in real-time. Additionally, MongoDB's ability to handle complex, unstructured data can be helpful in scenarios where data does not fit neatly into traditional table structures. Finally, MongoDB's support for distributed architectures and its ability to easily scale horizontally can make it a good choice for applications that require high availability and reliability.'''\n"

    "'''MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that offers a number of features that make it a preferred choice for many modern web and mobile applications. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible data model: MongoDB uses a document data model that allows for more flexible and dynamic data structures, compared to the rigid tabular data structure of SQL databases. Data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which supports a wide range of data types and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "High performance: MongoDB's native indexing capabilities, automatic sharding, and dynamic schema design make it highly performant, even when handling large volumes of data. It can support both read and write operations, which are executed at a high speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable and can be scaled horizontally across many machines to handle large volumes of data and traffic. This can be done through sharding, which involves distributing data across different nodes or clusters, or replication, which involves copying data across different nodes for increased availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced querying and indexing: MongoDB provides a powerful query language with support for a wide range of operations, including range queries, text search, geospatial queries, and aggregation. It also offers secondary indexes, text search indexes, and geospatial indexes to optimize query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic failover and high availability: MongoDB is designed to be highly available and resilient, with automatic failover and replication capabilities that ensure data is always accessible and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy integration with modern tech stacks: MongoDB integrates well with many modern technologies, including Node.js, React, Angular, and other web frameworks, as well as with popular cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these features make MongoDB a popular choice for developers building modern web and mobile applications, as it provides a highly flexible, performant, and scalable data store that can adapt to changing business needs.'''\n"
