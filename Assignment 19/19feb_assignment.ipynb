    "'''Flask is a popular Python web framework used for building web applications. It is a lightweight framework and is designed to be easy to use and flexible. Flask is open-source and is maintained by a community of developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to use: Flask is a simple and easy-to-use framework. It has a small codebase and is easy to understand and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework and has a small footprint. It does not come with any unnecessary features or dependencies, making it easy to deploy and scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible: Flask is highly flexible and can be customized to meet the needs of different web applications. It allows developers to add or remove features as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: Flask is highly extensible and has a large number of extensions available. These extensions can be used to add features such as authentication, database integration, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Community: Flask has a large and active community of developers. This means that there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting, as well as a large number of third-party extensions and plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated Testing: Flask provides built-in testing support, which allows developers to easily test their applications and ensure that they are working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Flask is a great choice for developers who want a flexible and lightweight web framework that is easy to use and customize.'''\n"

    "When a user visits a URL, Flask maps that URL to the appropriate view function and generates a response that is sent back to the user's browser. The view function can perform any necessary logic, such as querying a database or processing form data, and then generate an appropriate response, such as an HTML page or a JSON object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask to create a structured URL map for our web application. This makes it easy to organize our application into different views, each of which handles a specific URL or group of URLs. App routes also allow us to define the HTTP methods that are allowed for each view, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others.\n",
