The with statement is used in Python to automatically manage the lifetime of objects such as files. When using with in combination with open(), it ensures that the file is properly closed, even if an exception is raised during the execution of the code block inside the with statement.The advantage of using the with statement and open() together is that it helps to prevent resource leaks in the program. When a file is opened using the open() function, it needs to be properly closed using the close() method to release system resources. However, if an exception is raised during the execution of the code, the file may not be properly closed. The with statement provides a way to ensure that the file is closed automatically, even if an exception is raised
