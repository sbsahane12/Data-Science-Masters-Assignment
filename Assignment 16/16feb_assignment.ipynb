    "'''A database is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It can be thought of as an electronic filing cabinet, where data is stored and organized for easy retrieval and manipulation. Databases are used in various applications, from managing online transactions to storing customer information.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems. Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases have a predefined schema or structure, which means data is stored in tables with columns and rows. This makes it easy to organize data and ensures consistency. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not have a predefined schema and store data in a more flexible, document-oriented format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying: SQL databases use SQL for querying, which is a standardized language for interacting with databases. NoSQL databases use different query languages, such as MongoDB's query language or Cassandra's CQL (Cassandra Query Language).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that increasing performance requires adding more powerful hardware. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means that performance can be increased by adding more servers to a distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Compliance: SQL databases are designed to be ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, which means they ensure that transactions are processed reliably and securely. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, may sacrifice some of these properties to achieve greater scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: SQL databases are often used in applications that require a high level of data consistency, such as financial systems or inventory management. NoSQL databases are used in applications that require scalability and flexibility, such as social media platforms or data analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs of the application. SQL databases are a good fit for applications with a structured data schema and strict consistency requirements, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications that require high scalability and flexibility.'''\n"

    "'''In a relational database, a primary key and a foreign key are two important concepts that are used to establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. The values in the primary key column(s) must be unique and not null. The primary key is used to enforce the integrity and consistency of data in the table. It is also used as a reference in other tables to create relationships between them. For example, in a \"customers\" table, the \"customer_id\" column can be used as the primary key since it uniquely identifies each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to create relationships between two tables, which allow data to be shared between them. The foreign key column(s) in a table must match the data type and size of the primary key column(s) in the referenced table. For example, in an \"orders\" table, the \"customer_id\" column can be used as a foreign key that refers to the primary key of the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a foreign key is created, it establishes a relationship between two tables that is called a referential integrity constraint. This constraint ensures that the data in the foreign key column(s) of the referencing table matches the data in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table. The referential integrity constraint can be set to either restrict or cascade the changes made to the referenced table's primary key column(s) to the referencing table's foreign key column(s). If the constraint is set to restrict, the changes will be prevented if they violate the constraint. If it is set to cascade, the changes will be propagated to the referencing table.\n",
